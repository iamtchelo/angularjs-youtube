**A youtube app using angularjs!**
===================
Recently i've resolved to focus in **JavaScript** and other things, this month i've started to study angularjs. I always liked working with [YoutubeAPI](https://developers.google.com/youtube/) with Web Services on **PHP** and now with **JavaScript**.

This app show videos by **keywords**, all right?

Let's try:

You can choose a default keyword in ```controllers.js```

```js
// default keyword
$scope.query = 'keyword';
```

**Contribute**
